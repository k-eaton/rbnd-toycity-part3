1. How long did you spend working on this project?

A few days.  It should have been faster but 1) life got in the way, and 2) I do better when I have time for my brain to mull things over.  It works in the background and throws ideas to me a day or so later.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

Figuring out how to access the data in the objects.  Basic stuff, I know, and stupid because it was given to us in the instructions, but for some reason I had a block on it.  I kept treating it like a hash, and of course, that didn't work.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?

It made sense to me that if you could purchase things, you should be able to return them.  I almost created a whole new class for returns, but realized they were just another type of transaction.  I also thought it would be useful to find transactions by product, and be able to choose which kind of transaction you got in your results.  

4. Where do you still have room to grow?

Everywhere.  It'd feel arrogant to claim any sort of mastery at this level.  Plus there's so damn much to learn.
